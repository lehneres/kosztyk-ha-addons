A Home Assistant add-on that runs the **Pulse Docker Agent**, allowing your Home Assistant host and Docker containers to be monitored by the
[Pulse PVE Monitoring](https://github.com/rcourtman/Pulse) platform.

## 📊 What is Pulse PVE Monitoring?

**Pulse** is a modern, lightweight monitoring platform designed for:


- 🖥️ Proxmox VE nodes  
- 🐳 Docker hosts & containers

Pulse gives you:

- Real‑time dashboards  
- Auto-discovery of hosts  
- Minimal resource usage  
- Push-based agents  
- A unified web UI for all monitored systems

## 🧩 What This Add-on Does

This add-on installs and runs the **Pulse Docker Agent** on the same system where Home Assistant is running.  
It enables Pulse to collect metrics such as:

- CPU, RAM, disk usage of the Docker host running Home Assistant  
- Status and metrics of Docker containers  
- Extra remote Docker targets if configured

Under the hood, the add-on:

- Downloads the correct `pulse-docker-agent` binary for your architecture  
- Reads configuration from the Home Assistant add-on options  
- Exposes the Docker API (as per HA add-on permissions)  
- Sends metrics to your Pulse server at the configured interval  

---


## ⚙️ Home Assistant Add-on Configuration

The add-on exposes these options via the Home Assistant UI:

| Option          | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `pulse_url`     | ✅       | URL of your Pulse server (e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:7655`) |
| `api_token`     | ✅       | API token created in Pulse with `docker:report` scope |
| `interval`      | ✅       | Report interval, e.g. `30s`, `60s` |
| `log_level`     | ✅       | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `agent_version` | ✅       | Pulse agent version / tag to download |
| `extra_targets` | ✅       | Comma-separated list of extra Docker hosts |



> ℹ️ The add-on should validate that `pulse_url` and `api_token` are set before starting, and log a clear error if not.

> **Protection mode should be off for addon to work properlly.**
